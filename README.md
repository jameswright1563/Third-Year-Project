The "src" folder holds all the application files. The "tests" folder is located within this containing all the tests of my application.

The application can be launched through running the file "gui.py" in the src folder. Dependencies may need to be installed through the use of a command "pip install {dependency name}"

Python 3.9 will need to be installed.

The "Latex" folder holds all files related to my project report.
